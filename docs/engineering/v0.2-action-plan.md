    - Handle string literals, comments, regex patterns
    
[ ] Day 2: Token Classification & Color Schemes  
    - Define syntax highlighting colors for dark theme
    - Implement token-to-style mapping
    - Test with various JavaScript constructs
    
[ ] Day 3: NetBeans Integration & Testing

**Mitigation:** Benchmark before/after each change
**Fallback:** Revert specific changes, keep working improvements

**Risk:** Settings system integration issues
**Mitigation:** Use proven NetBeans NbPreferences patterns
**Fallback:** Simple properties file approach

### Schedule Risks
**Risk:** Scope creep during development
**Mitigation:** Strict adherence to sprint goals
**Response:** Move additional features to v0.3

**Risk:** Discovery of complex edge cases
