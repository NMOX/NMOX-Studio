# The Device Reference

Every unit in the rack, straight from the catalog — this file is
generated from `DeviceCatalog` by `DeviceDocsTest` and CI fails if it
drifts. Do not edit by hand; regenerate with:

```
mvn -pl rack test -Dtest=DeviceDocsTest -Dnmox.docs.write=true
```

## AUTOMATE

### MAESTRO — Master Control — fire whole pipelines

> Press RUN SEQUENCE to fire all four TRIG outs at once.
> Patch TRIG 1 → CRATE RUN, then chain OK jacks: install → build → test.

- **Out:** `TRIG 1` (trigger), `TRIG 2` (trigger), `TRIG 3` (trigger), `TRIG 4` (trigger)

### REFLEX — File Watcher — fire pipelines on save

> Flip WATCH on and every file save fires CHANGED.
> Patch CHANGED → VERITAS RUN for test-on-save; FILTER narrows to code/styles/docs, or GLOB to one lane (*.rs).

- **Out:** `CHANGED` (trigger), `PATH` (data)

### QUORUM — Lane Join — barrier: fire OK when all lanes pass

> The barrier where lanes converge: ALL fires OK once every wired IN has arrived and all passed.
> Patch each lane's DONE → IN, OK → LAUNCHPAD. MODE=ANY relays the first instead.

- **In:** `IN 1` (trigger), `IN 2` (trigger), `IN 3` (trigger), `IN 4` (trigger)
- **Out:** `OK` (trigger), `FAIL` (trigger), `DONE` (trigger)

### IGNITION — Polyglot Runtime — run anything: node/go/rust/py/rb/php

> Runs your project's main: cargo run, go run, mix run, python…
> TARGET=auto follows the detected toolchain; ARGS feed the command line.

- **In:** `RUN` (trigger), `STOP` (trigger), `ENABLE` (gate)
- **Out:** `OK` (trigger), `FAIL` (trigger), `DONE` (trigger), `OUT` (data), `RUNNING` (gate), `READY` (trigger), `URL` (data)

### NPM-9000 — Script Sequencer — run package.json scripts

> One package.json script per press. SCRIPT knob lists your scripts.
> Patch OK into the next device to chain scripts into pipelines.

- **In:** `RUN` (trigger)
- **Out:** `OK` (trigger), `FAIL` (trigger), `DONE` (trigger), `OUT` (data)

### TEMPO — Step Sequencer — fire pipelines on a clock

> A clock: TICK fires at the dialed rate, BAR every 4th tick.
> Gate it with ENABLE (patch SURGE RUNNING in) for health checks only while serving.

- **In:** `START` (trigger), `STOP` (trigger), `ENABLE` (gate)
- **Out:** `TICK` (trigger), `BAR` (trigger), `RUNNING` (gate)

### SOLDER — Custom Command — run anything as a pipeline step

> Runs exactly what you type - make seed-db, ./scripts/fixtures.sh - argv only, no shell.
> Patch VERITAS OK → RUN to chain custom steps; SOLDER exports to CI like any device.

- **In:** `RUN` (trigger)
- **Out:** `OK` (trigger), `FAIL` (trigger), `DONE` (trigger), `OUT` (data)

### DYNAMO — Grunt/Gulp task runner — dial a task, GO

> The Grunt/Gulp era as a device: TASK lists what the Gruntfile or gulpfile declares (static parse, instant).
> Dial a task, GO runs npx grunt/gulp <task>; RUNNER settles grunt-vs-gulp when a repo carries both. Patch OK onward to chain.

- **In:** `RUN` (trigger)
- **Out:** `OK` (trigger), `FAIL` (trigger), `DONE` (trigger), `OUT` (data)

## VERIFY

### CRATE — Package Manager — install & update deps

> INSTALL readies dependencies - in mixed repos it sequences every toolchain.
> UPDATE upgrades, CHECK reports outdated. OK fires when done.

- **In:** `RUN` (trigger)
- **Out:** `OK` (trigger), `FAIL` (trigger), `DONE` (trigger), `OUT` (data)

### FORGE — Build Engine — vite/webpack/rollup & co

> BUILD compiles with the detected tool (vite/cargo/mix/swift…).
> WATCH mode fires OK on every rebuild - patch OK → VERITAS for build-then-test.

- **In:** `RUN` (trigger)
- **Out:** `OK` (trigger), `FAIL` (trigger), `DONE` (trigger), `OUT` (data)

### VERITAS — Test Harness — jest/vitest/mocha...

> Runs the suite; the tally LCD shows live pass/fail.
> RUNNER=auto picks jest/pytest/cargo/mix… Patch OUT → MONITOR to read output.

- **In:** `RUN` (trigger)
- **Out:** `OK` (trigger), `FAIL` (trigger), `DONE` (trigger), `OUT` (data)

### PURITY — Lint Filter — biome/eslint/stylelint

> Static analysis; E/W counts land on the LCD, CLEAN lights when spotless.

- **In:** `RUN` (trigger)
- **Out:** `OK` (trigger), `FAIL` (trigger), `DONE` (trigger), `OUT` (data)

### GLOSS — Code Formatter — biome/prettier; pint on PHP lanes

- **In:** `RUN` (trigger)
- **Out:** `OK` (trigger), `FAIL` (trigger), `DONE` (trigger), `OUT` (data)

### TYPEGUARD — Type Checker — tsc, watch-aware; phpstan on PHP lanes

- **In:** `RUN` (trigger)
- **Out:** `OK` (trigger), `FAIL` (trigger), `DONE` (trigger), `OUT` (data)

### VITALS — Web Quality Gate — Lighthouse scores with a shipping floor

- **In:** `RUN` (trigger), `URL` (data)
- **Out:** `OK` (trigger), `FAIL` (trigger), `DONE` (trigger), `OUT` (data)

### PRISM — Bundle-Size Gate — weigh the build, hold the line

> Weighs the build output dir; MAX sets the budget.
> Patch FORGE OK → MEASURE and OK → LAUNCHPAD: bundles over budget don't ship.

- **In:** `MEASURE` (trigger)
- **Out:** `OK` (trigger), `FAIL` (trigger)

### GOVERNOR — Gas budget gate — forge snapshot --check

> CHECK runs forge snapshot --check against the committed .gas-snapshot; TOLERANCE allows dialed drift.
> Patch VERITAS OK → CHECK and OK → LAUNCHPAD: gas regressions physically cannot ship.

- **In:** `RUN` (trigger)
- **Out:** `OK` (trigger), `FAIL` (trigger), `DONE` (trigger), `OUT` (data)

### SPECTER — E2E Console — Playwright/Cypress run, served report, codegen recorder
