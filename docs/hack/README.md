# Real Talk: Building NMOX Studio with AI

*Late night hacker notes - the actual truth about what we're building*

## 🌙 3am Reality Check

Look, all those product docs and engineering specs are nice, but let's be real. This is a NetBeans RCP app that we're trying to modernize with AI doing 90% of the work. Here's what's actually going to happen.

## 🤖 What AI Can Actually Do

### The Good Stuff (AI Crushes This)
- Writing boilerplate NetBeans module code
- Creating service providers and lookup implementations  
- Generating test cases from existing code
- Writing documentation (obviously)
- Creating Maven configurations
- Implementing standard patterns (singleton, factory, etc.)
- Converting between data formats (JSON ↔ Java objects)

### The Tricky Bits (AI Needs Hand-Holding)
- NetBeans Platform specific APIs (documentation is sparse)
- Debugging module classloader issues
- Understanding NetBeans layer.xml files
- Getting the update center to work
- Making modules talk to each other properly
- UI threading issues with Swing

### The "Good Luck" Zone (You're On Your Own)
- Making NetBeans look modern (it's Swing, bro)
- Performance tuning the platform
- Getting native packaging to work on all platforms
- Dealing with signing/notarization for macOS
- Making it not use 2GB of RAM on startup

## 🎯 The Real MVP

Forget all that enterprise stuff. Here's what we're actually building:

```
Week 1: Get Something Running
- Basic NetBeans platform app
- One module that edits text files
- Syntax highlighting for JS (steal from existing)
- NPM runner (just shell commands)

Week 2: Make It Useful  
- Git integration (JGit is already there)
- Basic project templates
- Run build commands
- Show console output

Week 3: Make It Not Suck
- Fix the obvious bugs
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Dark theme (good luck with Swing)
- Basic auto-complete

Week 4: Ship It
- Create installers
- Put it on GitHub
- Write README
- Pray someone uses it
```

## 💻 Actual Architecture

```
nmox-studio/
├── branding/          # Make it not say NetBeans everywhere
├── application/       # The actual app (empty, just assembles modules)
└── modules/
    ├── editor-base/   # Text editing (use existing NetBeans)
    ├── npm-runner/    # ProcessBuilder + output window
    ├── git-simple/    # JGit wrapper
    └── web-stuff/     # Whatever we can hack together
```

That's it. That's the architecture.

## 🛠️ Tools We're Actually Using

- **IDE**: NetBeans (eating our own dog food)
- **AI**: Claude/ChatGPT for code generation
- **Version Control**: Git (duh)
- **Build**: Maven (NetBeans forces this)
- **Testing**: JUnit (when we remember)
- **CI**: GitHub Actions (free tier)
- **Distribution**: GitHub Releases

## 🚀 Getting Started (For Real)

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/NMOX/NMOX-Studio.git

# Open in NetBeans (yes, NetBeans to build NetBeans app)
# File -> Open Project -> select the folder

# Build it
mvn clean install

# Run it
mvn nbm:run-platform

# It probably crashed. Check the logs.
```

## 🎲 Success Metrics (Realistic)

- It starts without crashing ✅
- Can edit a JavaScript file ✅
- Can run npm commands ✅
- Has fewer bugs than Atom (RIP) 🤞
- Someone stars it on GitHub 🌟
- We learned something 📚
