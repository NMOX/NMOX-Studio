# The Realistic Timeline (With AI Doing The Work)

*What we can actually build as one person with AI assistance*

## üåô The Truth About AI Development Speed

### What AI Makes Faster (10x)
- Boilerplate code generation
- Test writing
- Documentation
- Maven configurations
- Standard patterns

### What AI Doesn't Help With (1x)
- Debugging NetBeans classloader issues
- Understanding why modules won't load
- Making Swing look good
- Performance optimization
- Platform-specific packaging

### What AI Makes Slower (0.5x)
- Fixing hallucinated APIs
- Debugging AI-generated code
- Untangling wrong patterns
- Correcting misconceptions

## üìÖ Actual Timeline

### Day 1-2: Setting Up (Fighting Tools)
```
Morning:
- Install NetBeans ‚úì
- Create Maven project ‚úì
- Get "Hello World" platform app running ‚úì

Afternoon:
- Module won't load ‚úó
- ClassNotFoundException ‚úó
- Google netbeans platform errors ‚úó

Evening:
- Finally works
- Commit whatever works
- Don't touch it
```

### Day 3-4: First Module (Learning Curve)
```
What you plan:
- Create JavaScript editor module

What happens:
- Copy example from NetBeans source
- Modify until it breaks
- Revert
- Modify less
- Works!
- No idea why
```

### Day 5-6: NPM Integration (The Easy Part)
```java
// This actually works first try
ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("npm", "install");
pb.directory(projectDir);
Process p = pb.start();

// AI is good at this stuff
```

### Day 7-8: Making It Look Decent
```
Try: Custom look and feel
Reality: FlatLaf dark theme
Result: Good enough

Try: Custom icons
Reality: Use defaults
Result: Good enough

Try: Modern layout
Reality: NetBeans default
Result: Good enough
```

### Day 9-10: Packaging Nightmare
```
Windows: Creates .exe (eventually)
Mac: Requires signing ($99/year)
Linux: Here's a zip file

Solution: GitHub releases with zip files
"Portable edition"
```

### Day 11-12: Testing and Bugs
```
Testing: Launch it, click around
Bugs found: 47
Bugs fixed: 5 (the obvious ones)
Bugs marked "known issues": 42
```

### Day 13-14: Documentation and Release
```
README.md: 1 hour
Screenshots: 2 hours  
GitHub release: 30 minutes
Reddit post: 10 minutes
Waiting for feedback: ‚àû
```

## ü§ñ AI Development Workflow

### Morning Session (Fresh Brain)
```
1. Human: Architect the solution
2. Human: Write core logic
3. AI: Generate boilerplate
4. Human: Fix AI mistakes
5. Human: Test and debug
```

### Afternoon Session (Tired Brain)
```
1. AI: Write tests
2. AI: Generate documentation
3. AI: Create Maven configs
4. Human: Copy-paste and commit
```

### Evening Session (Dead Brain)
```
1. Human: Browse Reddit
2. Human: Update README
3. Human: Push to GitHub
4. Human: Wonder why you're doing this
```

## üí∞ Resource Reality

## üé™ The Cycle of Open Source

```
1. Enthusiasm: "I'll build the best IDE!"
2. Reality: "NetBeans is complicated"
3. Compromise: "It just needs to edit files"
4. Sprint: "14 days of coding"
5. Ship: "Version 0.1.0!"
6. Excitement: "People are using it!"
7. Overwhelm: "So many issues"
8. Burnout: "I'm done"
9. Abandonment: "Feel free to fork"
10. Peace: "Never again"
11. Forgetting: "You know what would be cool..."
12. GOTO 1
```
