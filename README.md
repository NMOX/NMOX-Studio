## Architecture

NMOX Studio follows a clean, modular architecture based on the NetBeans Platform:

### Service Management
The application uses a centralized service management system that provides:
- **Automatic Discovery**: Services are automatically discovered through the Lookup system
- **Lifecycle Management**: Proper initialization and cleanup of services
- **Event Notification**: Service registration/unregistration events
- **Type Safety**: Strongly-typed service retrieval

### Module System
Each module is a self-contained NetBeans module (NBM) with:
- **Clear Dependencies**: Explicit module dependencies
- **API Separation**: Clean separation between API and implementation
- **Resource Management**: Proper resource bundling and internationalization
- **Testing Support**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Development

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run tests for specific module
mvn test -pl core

# Build without tests
mvn package -DskipTests

# Generate test reports
mvn surefire-report:report
```

### Adding New Modules

1. Create module directory structure
2. Add module POM with proper dependencies
3. Register module in parent POM
4. Implement module functionality
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Update documentation

### Code Quality

The project maintains high code quality through:
- **Static Analysis**: Compiler warnings and linting
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with JUnit 5
- **Integration Testing**: NetBeans platform integration tests
- **Code Review**: Pull request review process
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline and external documentation
